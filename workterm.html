            Software Developer at CGI (May - Dec 2021)
        </div>
        <div class='para'>
            In May 2021, i was hired at CGI as a software developer and planned to work on an 
            8-month term up to December. Although it was all work-from-home up to now, this has
            not stopped me from constantly learning and improving upon many aspects of my skillsets
            while at CGI. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class='para-header-2'>
            What i've done so far?
        </div>
        <div class='para'>
            My first two weeks at CGI was actually rather slow in terms of doing actual
            work. Instead, this time helped me understand the basic workflow of my team,
            observe how each team member fills specific roles and overall learn about 
            the vision of the company. Then, after the first few weeks of ramping to the 
            skill level required, i began taking on a few tasks here and there. The first
            few tasks i got was to test their software they were building. (Just a quick note for the reader who might not be aware 
            of the workflow of developing software - first we have the development phase, then comes the testing phase). 
            The team of testers consisted of 4 persons including me and i got to learn a lot from each
            one of them. They gave me advice and showed me best practices regarding testing of software.
            I was part of that testing phase for about a month, before moving on to the actual
            development of the app. Development is usually a bit more challenging but since i was
            already proficient in the programming language they were using, it did not take me long to 
            adjust to their code base.

            Work Samples
        </div>
        <div class='para'>
            At the time when i started on the testing team, they were actually facing
            some issues where the testing phase of the project was taking too long and too much manual
            effort was required. Hence, they wanted to automate the 
            testing process and asked me if i could be in charge of automating the process. Although i was not sure
            if i was up to par to solve the issue, i gladly took on the task as a challenge for myself.
            For a few days, I made some research and found a third party testing tool called "Newman" which 
            does exactly what we needed, automated testing. Initially i thought it was that easy, just using 
            a third party tool and that i didn't have to write additional code for it to work. However, there was some limitations
            to this tool where it could run only one test file at a time, which is not very ideal since the
            company had a huge database of such test files. It was then that i had
            to use my programming knowledge to build a program on top of this existing "Newman" tool. I had to code
            some additional logic of my own to make it work on a big database of test files that
            the company were already using.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <div><img src='images/worksample_1.PNG'></div>
            This image is an example of how their test collections database looked like. Basically 
            the program i develop will continuously search each subfolder as long as there is more
            nested levels. Once it reached the last levels where you can see the test1.json, test2.json files,
            it will take those, merge them together and bring them at the root folder called "test_collections".
            After doing this process on all folders namely the service1 and service2 folders, we end up with a big 
            collection of tests merged together into a big single file, which perfectly adapted to the limitation of that "Newman" tool.
            In other words, i'm still feeding the "Newman" tool a single file to run but that file contains the entire
            test collection database that the company had.

            This image is the report page that the "Newman" tool will output after running the tests. Here, you can see 
            some very valuable data that the company will use in order to know how their app is performing, based on the 
            number of tests it is passing or failing. In the end, this automated process that i helped develop will help
            the company monitor the performance of their software on a regular basis.

            Reflecting on my work term goals?
        </div>
        <div class='para'>
            Some initial goals set:
            <ul>
                <li>Improve my programming skills in Java.</li>
                <li>Improve my interpersonal skills in regards to working in a team.</li>
                <li>Improve my decision making/analytical skills whenever faced with challenges in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Build my network in order to facilate my future job search endeavors.</li>
            </ul>
            So far,
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I did improve my Java skills as i took on this small project on automated testing that i talked about in the above paragraphs.
                    Also, by being part of two big project, i got to experience different phases of development from the building blocks of the code,
                    to deploying the service to the end customer. Hence, i improved by programming skills in a very holistic way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Especially during the last 4 months, i greatly improved my teamwork skills as my teammates and i would frequently work on solving various
                    coding issues together. By building off of each other's idea, we could always deliver the best possible solution in the end.
                <li>
                    Since i was working on such big scale projects, for some the tasks assigned, i had to really analyse the situation before actually coding it.
                    Especially since the project had many subparts, i had to design my code in a way such that it would not break any other parts of the project, 
                    and also keep it scalable (i.e. easy to add new functionalities without changing the code too much).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since the whole term was carried online, it was quite hard to meet people like you would do in an office environment. However, even online, i made
                    some good connections with several colleagues as we shared knowledge based on our own experiences so far, whether academic or just life in general. 
                    Moreover, since my supervisor was really satisfied with my work, he suggested that i reach out to him after i graduate to see what current opportunities might 
                    be a fit for me.
                </li>
            </ul>
