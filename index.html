        <div class='para'>
            Hi! my name is <span class='highlight'>Emile</span> and I am currently a 3rd year student
            at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science with a focus on software engineering.
            So far, my journey at UofT has allowed me to acquire and improve upon many of my interpersonal
            and technical skills. With all the courses I have taken, I improved immensely on my time management
            skills and gained a lot of experience in various programming langugaes such as Java, Python, C and
            JavaScript. Starting from my second year, I also got the chance to do a few co-op internships in various fields of the tech
            industry. My first internship allowed me to have a breakthrough into the world of web development where i learned
            the best standards and practices regarding frontend and backend development of a website. On the other hand, my second
            and current co-op placement is more focused on the backend side of things where i'm part of a team,
            developing software for big corporates such as banks to readily send and receive data from third party servers
            in a reliable manner. Career-wise, I wish to become a software engineer/developer and work at a company 
            whose technology is very innovative and has a positive impact on the world.
